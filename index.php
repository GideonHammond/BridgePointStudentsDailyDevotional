        <b>The Beatitudes</b>: This verse says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled." The Greek- dikaiosynÄ“n- is translated as "what is right, justice, and the act of doing what is in agreement with God's standards, the state of being in proper relationship with God." Essentially righteousness is following the biblical standards. It is growing the relationship between you and God. It is very important as when you are righteous you are "filled." This is another important thing. When you are filled you are satisfied. Sinning is always paining and often leads to regret and hurt (1). Sin does fulfill you and will only corrupt your view on life and your health. Sin leads only to more sin so stop while you can walk away from anything that you keep doing and separate yourself from any sin (2). Then you can accept God's fulfillment and blessing.
        <br><br><b>Verses</b>: 1- Romans 6:23 and 2- James 4:7
        <br><br><b>Other cross-references</b>: Psalm 107:9, John 4:14, and Isaiah 55:1-3
        <br><br><b>Main Verses</b>: Matthew 5:6 and John 6
        <br><br><b>To Pray</b>: Pray that any perpetual sin you commit will stop. Pray for a loving attitude towards others and that you can learn how to receive God's gifts. Pray that you can love those around you and treat everyone around you with love and kindness.
