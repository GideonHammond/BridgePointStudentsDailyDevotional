        This was a project I started in October of 2024, I was going to host my own webpage and then use JSON on the backend to automatically update a website. Now it is all done. Originally this was a church project to make sure that anyone could access instead of me giving them out on a text or email thread. I haven't been making anymore devotionals lately but all of the old ones I wrote are in the <a href="https://bpsdd.com/list.html">archive!</a>
        <br><br> It has been about 2 years since that has been true! whew time goes by fast... (Is anyone ever going to read this.) As I said before this is a passion project which is a website to streamline devotionals. I don't know what I am going to do but it now has a nice coat of paint. I may get back into it. If you have any advice for the site, want to author devos, or have any questions you can contact me on my personal cell. (if you don't have my number, just drop by during wednesday and I'll gladly chat.)
